#        Imagine you want to store the names of three of your friends in a list of Strings. 
#        Create a list variable called friends_names, and write the syntax to store the full names of three of your friends.
#        Now write statements to print out the name of the first friend, then the name of the last friend, and finally the length of the list.
#        Now define a list called friends_ages, that stores the age of each of your friends in a corresponding manner.
#        i.e. the first entry of this list is the age of the friend named first in your other list.
