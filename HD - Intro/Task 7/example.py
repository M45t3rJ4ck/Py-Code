# =============  Writing if statements ==================
# if statements are a type of control structure which controls the flow of logic within a program.
# Let us consider a real-life example:
#    Imagine you are wanting to attend a movie premiere and your favourite actor/actress is there, but you have homework to do.
#    So if your homework is done, then you would attend the premiere, else you would do your homework.
# In Python, we have the if statement which resembles how we would normally speak about conditions.

# Example 1:

if (age >= 18):
	print ("You're over 18 and can come in.")

# Explanation:

# Before we continue, remember in casting we had some code wanting us to input an age?
# We check if the age is greater than or equal to 18, if the age meets the condition, then the person is allowed inside and if they are not 18 and older, then they
#are too young.

#  Q: Why is there a colon at the end of the if statement?
#  A: The colon, as in the English language, serves the purpose of adding extra information.
#      In Python, the colon means that here is code following that statement and can only run if the statement's criteria is met.

#  Q: Why is the code after the colon indented? And is it important?
#  A: The indentation means that certain code follows from the colon and in this case we have that certain code follows from the if statements. 
#      The indentation is there to demonstrate that the program's logic will follow the path indicated by it.
#      Every line in the indentation will run if the program's if statements conditions are met.

#  Q: Why do we write the lines of code below each other? 
#  A: The way that programs are run is done in a similar manner to how we humans read books or a newspaper.
#      We read from the top through to the bottom, in programming, this concept is called sequential programming.
#      Sequential programming involves logically ordered instructions to alter data and serve a purpose. 
#      Imagine if one of your elder family members were to give you random instructions? It wouldn't work very well.
#      Sequential programming is the only programming philosophy we are going follow in this course.
