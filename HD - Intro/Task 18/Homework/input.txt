At first, I wasn't sure if I would make it in the programming industry. The more I code the more I realize that it's not that difficult, it's literaly the way you think and speak to the computer...it's like speaking to another person when you're both from other countries and natively speak different languages, almost like speaking broken english. I am definitaly more confident in my programming ability and knowing that I can build the skils nessicary to sustain a programming career.
