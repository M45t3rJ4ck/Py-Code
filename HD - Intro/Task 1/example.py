# ================== What is Pseudocode? ================== 
# An algorithm is a step by step method for solving a problem.
# Pseudocode is a detailed yet informal description of what a computer program or algorithm must do.
# It is a simple way of writing programming code in English and does not obey any specific syntax rules.
# Syntax is basically the “spelling and grammar rules” of a programming language.
# Pseudocode is easy to write and understand even if you have no programming experience.
# You simply need to write down a logical breakdown of what you want your program to do. 

# Take a look at some the examples of pseudocode below 


# ************ Example 1 ************ 

# An algorithm that prints out passed or failed depending on whether a student's grade is greater than or equal to 50:

# if grade is equal to or greater than 50
#       print "passed"
# else
#       print "failed"


# ************ Example 2 ************ 


# An algorithm that asks a user to enter their name and prints out "Hello, World" if their name is "John":

# request user's name
# if the inputted name is equal to "John"
#       print "Hello, World"


# ************ Example 3 ************ 


# An algorithm that requests an integer from the user and prints "fizz" if the number is even or "buzz" if it is odd:

# request an integer from the user
# if the integer is even
#       print "fizz"
# else if the integer is odd
#       print "buzz"

# == Make sure you have read and understood all of the code in this Python file.
# == Please complete the compulsory task below to proceed to the next task ===
# == Ensure you complete your work in this folder so that one of our tutors can easily locate and mark it ===



# ================= Compulsory Task ==================

# Create a new text file called "pseudo.txt" inside this folder. 
# Inside "pseudo.txt", write pseudocode for the following scenarios:
#       - An algorithm that asks a user to infinitely enter a positive number until the user enters a zero value,
#         and then determines and outputs the largest of the inputted numbers.
#       - An algorithm that reads in an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average. 
#       - An algorithm that prints out the products (in alphabetical order) still to buy from a list of grocery items.
#       - An algorithm for the flowchart found in the PDF


# ================= BONUS Optional Task ==================
# Create a new text file called "Optional_task.txt" inside this folder. 
# Inside "Optional_task.txt", write pseudocode for the following scenario:
#       An algorithm that asks the user to enter four numbers, sorts those numbers from smallest to largest and then
#       prints the sorted numbers.
