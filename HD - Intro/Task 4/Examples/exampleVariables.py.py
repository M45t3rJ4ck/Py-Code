# ========= Variables ===========
# We can imagine that a variable is a place-holder which holds certain things on-demand. 
# We use variables to store data in a program.


num = 2  
num = 3  


# We assigned the number 2 to the variable 'num'.
# Then we overwrite num with the value of 3 and 2 is automatically 'forgotten'.


# When coding in Python, you can call variables anything you want, but try using descriptive variable names.


myName = "Tom"      
variableOne = "Tom" 


# myName is a good variable name.
# variableOne is not a good variable name, as it doesn't give a description of what would be stored inside it.
# Thus a good variable name is one that describes the data that is stored inside it.
# Variables can store different Data Types.


numTwo = 3 
nameTwo = "John" 
numThree = 0.5 


# The variable numTwo stores an integer value.
# The variable nameTwo stores a String value.
# The variable numThree stores a double, or real number, value.


# We can output the value of variables as follows:


print numTwo 
print nameTwo
print numThree 


# Run this program and take a look at the output. The three lines above generated that output.
# They printed out the VALUES of each variable.


# We can overwrite variables, as shown above with the num variable and below with the abc variable:


abc = "A"
abc = "B"  


# A variable always stores the LAST value that was stored in it.
# Thus the abc variable stores the "B" value.
