#This is an example program.
#The purpose of this program is to demonstrate different operations of different variables.

numOne = 10
numDouble = numOne*numOne 

#Can use a variable to create new variables.

#But don't forget a space between the two names, otherwise nameFull just stores "TimAdams"

nameFull = nameFirst + " " + nameSecond 

#Adding a space in-between the names
