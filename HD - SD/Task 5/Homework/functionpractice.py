# Create a new python file in this folder called functionPractice.py
# Define a function, sumAll(n) that sums all numbers from to 1 to n.
# For example, calling sumAll(10) should return the answer to 1 +2+3...+10
# The function sumAll will have to use a for loop to carry out this summation,
# and it will have to use a sum variable that increases in value over each
# iteration of the for loop.

n = int(input("Please enter a number for range max limit: \n"))

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_all = sum_all + i
            return sum_all
print(sum_all(n))
