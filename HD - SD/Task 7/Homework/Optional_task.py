# === Optional Challenge ==
# The strings must be formatted in such a way:
# AA Sequence 1: ILLVFMCAAGPT
# AA Sequence 2: ILLCFMCAAGPS
#               ***_*******_
# Alignment: 83%
# Where there is a match in amino acids, a * should be printed beneath the pair. Where there isn't a match,
# a '_' should be printed beneath the pair.
# The percentage of aligned (matching) characters should also be out-printed.
# In bioinformatics, the alignment % of the DNA of two different animals can tell us how closely related
# they are to each other. More closely related animals with a higher alignment share common physical features.
# You should now have a program named SickleCellDisease.py that has functions mutate, translate and txtTranslate
# And a program called AminoAlign.py with the function align.
